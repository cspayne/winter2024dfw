In Winter 2024, as an MLIS student at the University of Washington, I completed a quarter of Directed Fieldwork supervised by the Science and Book Arts Cataloger at the University of Washington libraries. This website serves as a repository for this experience, including my learning outcomes, artifacts, and a weekly blog that I kept during this time.
